Hello!  I'm Dave, I live in North Carolina and I love programming.  I also love tinkering with cars, mountain biking, taking care of my large pack of dogs and my chickens.

For years, I thought I hated Javascript but over the last year(s) I've grown to absolutely love it.  I am a mechanical engineer with almost 30 years experience programming and am comfortable in VB6/VBA, VB.Net, C# for front-end and backend.  I love the new Blazor framework for web development.  I have also built web front ends in Javascript/Typescript with Angular and Svelte.  I have also dabbled in React and Vue.

Recently worked on an app in SvelteKit with THREE.Js using Rich Harris' svelte-cubed.

Have recently moved back to C# and .Net, and using Silk.NET with OpenGL for 3D graphics, including GPU compute.  This is super cool, and now working my way through porting to Vulkan to get a little closer to the metal.

Always aspire to be the person your dog(s) think that you are.
