Hello!  I'm Dave, I live in North Carolina and I love programming.  I also love tinkering with cars, mountain biking, taking care of my large pack of dogs and my chickens.

For years, I thought I hated Javascript but over the last year(s) I've grown to absolutely love it.  I am a mechanical engineer with almost 30 years experience programming and am comfortable in VB6/VBA, VB.Net, C# for front-end and backend.  I love the new Blazor framework for web development.  I have also built web front ends in Javascript/Typescript with Angular and Svelte.  I have also dabbled in React and Vue.

Currently working on an app in SvelteKit with THREE.Js using Rich Harris' svelte-cubed.

Always aspire to be the person your dog(s) think that you are.
