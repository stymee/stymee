Hello!  I'm Dave, I live in North Carolina and I love programming.  I also love tinkering with cars, mountain biking, taking care of my large pack of dogs and my chickens.

For years, I thought I hated Javascript but over the last 6 months I've grown to absolutely love it.  I am a mechanical engineer with almost 30 years experience programming and am extremely comfortable in VB6/VBA, VB.Net, C# for both front-end and backend.  I love the new Blazor framework for web development.  I have also built front ends in Javascript/Typescriptwith Angular and Svelte along with RxJs.  I have dabbled in React and Vue enough to know that learning another framework is the easy part.  My latest craze is vanilla Javascript with THREE.Js while also learning functional programming (trying to, at least.  A quarter century of OO is hard to get out of your head).

Always aspire to be the person your dog(s) think that you are.
